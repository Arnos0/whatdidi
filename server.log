INFO: Clerk: The request to /dashboard is being redirected because there is no signed-in user, and the path is not included in `ignoredRoutes` or `publicRoutes`. To prevent this behavior, choose one of:

1. To make the route accessible to both signed in and signed out users, add "/dashboard" to the `publicRoutes` array passed to authMiddleware
2. To prevent Clerk authentication from running at all, add "/dashboard" to the `ignoredRoutes` array passed to authMiddleware
3. Pass a custom `afterAuth` to authMiddleware, and replace Clerk's default behavior of redirecting unless a route is included in publicRoutes

For additional information about middleware, please visit https://clerk.com/docs/nextjs/middleware
(This log only appears in development mode, or if `debug: true` is passed to authMiddleware)
