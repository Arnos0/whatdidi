# Gmail API Rate Limit Fix

## Problem
When scanning 210 emails, the system hit Gmail's rate limit (429 error) because it was trying to fetch too many emails concurrently.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Reduced Concurrent Requests
- Changed from fetching all emails at once to processing 5 at a time
- Added 1-second delay between batches
- Shows progress as emails are fetched

### 2. Smaller Processing Batches
- Reduced batch size from 50 to 20 emails
- Prevents overwhelming the API with too many requests

### 3. Automatic Retry Logic
- Detects 429 rate limit errors
- Waits for the specified retry time (or 5 seconds)
- Retries failed requests up to 3 times
- Continues processing even if some batches fail

### 4. Better Error Handling
- Individual batch failures don't stop the entire scan
- Logs progress throughout the process
- Provides clear feedback on what's happening

## Expected Behavior

Now when you scan emails:
1. It will find all matching emails (210 in your case)
2. Process them 5 at a time with delays
3. You'll see progress logs like "Fetched 25/210 messages..."
4. If rate limited, it will wait and retry automatically
5. The scan will take longer but complete successfully

## Performance Notes

- Scanning 210 emails will take approximately 3-4 minutes
- Progress is saved as it goes, so failures can be resumed
- Each email is processed individually to avoid losing data

## Try Again!

Run another scan - it should now complete successfully, though it will take a bit longer due to the rate limiting protection.
