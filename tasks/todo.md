## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL PRODUCTION ISSUE ðŸš¨
**URGENT**: Production users getting "User not found" error when creating orders.
- **Issue**: Authenticated users can't create orders on whatdidi.shop
- **Cause**: Likely missing SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in Vercel environment
- **Fix Guide**: See `/PRODUCTION_DEBUGGING_GUIDE.md` for step-by-step solution
- **Priority**: HIGH - Fix this before continuing development

## Current Status
**Phase**: 8 - Order Management (Create) âœ… COMPLETED  
**Progress**: 
- Foundation Setup âœ… COMPLETED
- Authentication Setup âœ… COMPLETED (including beta access system + Google OAuth)
- Design System Modernization âœ… COMPLETED (shadcn/ui implementation)

## Development Guidelines
1. Each task should be completable in 15-30 minutes
2. Test each feature before marking as complete
3. Commit after each completed phase
4. Keep changes minimal and focused
5. Document any deviations from the plan

## Notes
- Priority is on getting a working MVP quickly
- Email parsing accuracy can be improved iteratively
- Start with manual order entry to provide immediate value
- Tracking integration can be basic initially
