| 270 emails | 9 minutes | ~1.5 minutes |
| Rate limits | Severe (40k tokens/min) | None (4M tokens/min) |
| Batch size | 3 emails | 20-30 emails |

## Switching Between AI Providers

You can easily switch between Claude and Gemini:

```bash
# Use Gemini (recommended)
AI_SERVICE=gemini

# Use Claude (if needed)
AI_SERVICE=claude
```

## Cost Savings Example

For a typical user scanning 1000 emails/month:
- **Claude**: $3.00/month
- **Gemini**: $0.07/month
- **Savings**: 97.7% reduction in costs!

## Troubleshooting

### "GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY is not set" error
- Make sure you've added the key to `.env.local`
- Restart your development server after adding the key

### Rate limit errors with Gemini
- Gemini has extremely high rate limits (4M tokens/min)
- If you hit limits, you're likely doing something wrong
- Check for infinite loops or excessive retries

### Accuracy issues
- Both Claude and Gemini use similar prompts
- Accuracy should be comparable
- If you notice issues, please report them

## Advanced Configuration

### Adjusting Batch Sizes
In `app/api/email-accounts/[id]/scan/route.ts`, you can adjust:
```typescript
const batchSize = process.env.AI_SERVICE === 'claude' ? 10 : 50
```

### Custom Temperature
In `lib/ai/gemini-service.ts`, adjust the temperature:
```typescript
generationConfig: {
  responseMimeType: 'application/json',
  temperature: 0.1 // Lower = more consistent, Higher = more creative
}
```

## Production Deployment

Don't forget to add `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` to your Vercel environment variables!

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Settings → Environment Variables
4. Add `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` and `AI_SERVICE=gemini`
5. Redeploy
